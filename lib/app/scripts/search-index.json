When the page is first loaded, this is the initial request that returns HTML content. When the browser processes the HTML content, it spawns more requests to load resources like JS, CSS and images. It also executes JavaScript and sends AJAX requests to the server. To make this process efficient, we need to compress the assets and make fewer (possibly less than 6) requests to load everything we need. Fortunately, static resources can be cached and only downloaded the first time. If they cause slowness, it happens on the first page load only and may be tolerable.
