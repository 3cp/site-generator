          <h3>Aurelia and Kendo UI</h3>
          <p>Today, I&#x27;m really excited to introduce to you three innovative community members: Nikolaj Ivancic, Charles Pockert and Jeroen Vinke. They&#x27;ve been working together to create native Aurelia components for the Kendo UI suite, as well as a number of other tools for &quot;bridging&quot; the gap between existing component libraries and Aurelia. I asked them to put together a blog post that we could share with you here, announcing and explaining their work. Read on to learn more about the Aurelia UI Toolkits project.</p>
