    <h1>rejectErrorResponses Method</h1>
    <h2>Causes Responses whose status codes fall outside the range 200-299 to reject.
The fetch API only rejects on network errors or other conditions that prevent
the request from completing, meaning consumers must inspect Response.ok in the
Promise continuation to determine if the server responded with a success code.
This method adds a response interceptor that causes Responses with error codes
to be rejected, which is common behavior in HTTP client libraries.</h2>
