    <h2>Implement this hook if you want to perform custom logic after the constructor has been called.
At this point in time, the view has also been created and both the view-model and the view
are connected to their controller. The hook will recieve the instance of the &quot;owningView&quot;.
This is the view that the component is declared inside of. If the component itself has a view,
this will be passed second.</h2>
