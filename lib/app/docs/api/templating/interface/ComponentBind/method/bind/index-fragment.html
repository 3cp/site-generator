    <h1>bind Method</h1>
    <h2>Implement this hook if you want to perform custom logic when databinding is activated on the view and view-model.
The &quot;binding context&quot; to which the component is being bound will be passed first.
An &quot;override context&quot; will be passed second. The override context contains information used to traverse
the parent hierarchy and can also be used to add any contextual properties that the component wants to add.</h2>
